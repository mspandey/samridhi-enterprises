## 🚀 First-Time Contributor Onboarding

If this is your first contribution to this project, follow these steps exactly:

### 1. Fork the repository

Click **Fork** at the top right of the GitHub repository page. This creates your own copy under your account.

### 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/samridhi-enterprises.git
cd samridhi-enterprises
```

### 3. Add the upstream remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SRV30/samridhi-enterprises.git
```

This lets you pull in future changes from the original repo.

### 4. Create a branch from `elusoc`

```bash
git checkout elusoc
git pull upstream elusoc
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Always branch off `elusoc`, not `main`. Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-search-filter`
- `bugfix/cart-quantity-error`
- `docs/improve-readme`

### 5. Set up your local environment

Follow the **Local Development Setup** section in the [README.md](./README.md) to get both the server and client running locally before making any changes.

### 6. Make your changes

- Keep your changes focused — one issue per PR.
- Test your changes locally before committing.
- Follow the coding standards below.

### 7. Commit your changes

```bash
git add path/to/changed/file
git commit -m "feat: add search filter to product listing"
```

See [Commit Message Conventions](#-commit-message-conventions) below.

### 8. Push and open a PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then go to your fork on GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**. Make sure the base branch is set to `SRV30/samridhi-enterprises:elusoc`.

In your PR:
- Write a clear title and description.
- Reference the issue it closes: `Closes #N`.
- Describe what you changed and why.

### 9. Respond to review

A Project Admin will review your PR. If changes are requested, push new commits to the same branch — the PR updates automatically.
